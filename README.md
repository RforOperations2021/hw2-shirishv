This repository contains the R shiny dashboard code for HW2.

For this homework, I used the Port Authority of Allegheny County's (PAAC) data on Park and Rides.
The dashboard answers three following questions:
1. How is the distribution of Park & Ride lots look like?
2. What are lots' utilization rates?
3. Where are all the lots located?

It also has a couple of datatables to see the raw and aggregated data based on the selected inputs.
